**rom-sorter**

This util can sort ROM files for you, depending on the file extension within an archive (it use a first found file in the root folder).

For example, GoodGEN ROMs library combines games from Genesis and 32x platforms together; and GoodGBx makes the same with Game Boy and Game Boy Color. You can easily split games from different platforms to subfolders using this RomSorter.

Works only with .7z archives! (maybe, needs slight modifications to work with other formats, just not test it myself)

**Built version for Windows can be found [HERE](https://github.com/ManeFunction/RomSorter/releases)!**
